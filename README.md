# Fader

## Description:
Provides a fading animation for elements that use the directive. I've used this on divs that wrap around entire pages to give a fade effect upon navigation. Speed and opacity can be tweaked to achieve desired effects.

This may be obsolete now due to the creation and refinement of Angular's animation utilities.

## Dependencies:
* AngularJS 1.0.4

## Notes:
* Angular has changed a lot since this directive was written, so its entirely possible that it doesn't work with newer versions.

## Sample Usage:
```
<div data-fade>
	<!-- Content -->
</div>
```
